## üîß Simplified Configuration

StreamViX uses a **unified proxy system** that simplifies configuration:

### üåê Unified MFP Proxy
- **A single URL and password** for all content (movies, series, anime, TV)

### üìã Required Configuration
- `MFP_URL`: URL of your MFP proxy (e.g. `https://mfp.yourdomain.com`)
- `MFP_PASSWORD` or `MFP_PSW`: Password of the MFP proxy
- `TMDB_API_KEY`: TMDB API key for metadata (OPTIONAL)
- `ANIMEUNITY_ENABLED`: Enable AnimeUnity (true/false)
- `ANIMESATURN_ENABLED`: Enable AnimeSaturn (true/false)
- `Enable MPD Streams`: (true/false) Not working, leave false
- `Enable Live TV`: Enable to view live TV and sports events (true/false)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sports Events Configuration (Optional)
- `SPON_PROG_URL`: Custom URL for Sportzonline prog.txt download (default: auto)
- `SPON_PROG_FALLBACKS`: Additional fallback URLs comma-separated
- `RBTV_PLAYLIST_URL`: RB77 playlist URL (default: auto)
- `SPSO_PLAYLIST_URL`: SPSO playlist URL (default: auto)
- `STREAMED_ENABLE`: Enable Streamed integration (0/1)
- `STREAMED_PLAYLIST_URL`: Streamed playlist URL
  
### üñ•Ô∏è Environment Variable for Local / VPS (VixSrc FHD)

To reliably obtain Full HD VixSrc streams (forced `&h=1` + synthetic endpoint) on **local or VPS/self‚Äëhosted** installations you must set an environment variable telling the extractor what the publicly reachable BASE URL of your addon is.

Set it (WITHOUT trailing slash):

```
ADDON_BASE_URL=https://your-domain-or-ip
```

Important notes:
* No trailing slash (‚úÖ `https://myaddon.example` ‚ùå `https://myaddon.example/`).
* Only needed for local / VPS / Docker self‚Äëhost: public hosted instance (default `https://streamvix.hayd.uk`) already works without manual config.
* If you don‚Äôt set it the addon falls back to `https://streamvix.hayd.uk`; streams will still work, but synthetic FHD building may not trigger correctly when accessed via a private/local hostname.
* The variable is used to construct the internal `/vixsynthetic` endpoint (multi‚Äëaudio + best video) ‚Äî without a correct base it cannot generate that URL.
* Do NOT put the VixSrc domain itself (it will be ignored).

Optional related flag:
```
VIX_DUAL=1
```
Forces the dual exposure (Direct/Proxy + Synthetic FHD variants) when you are running headless / legacy configs without the landing page FHD pill.

Example environment block in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
    - ADDON_BASE_URL=https://streamvix.mydomain.xyz
    - MFP_URL=https://mfp.mydomain.xyz
    - MFP_PSW=supersecret
    - VIX_DUAL=1        # optional
    - TMDB_API_KEY=xxxxx
```

Restart the container/process after changing `ADDON_BASE_URL` so it‚Äôs picked up.

#### üîç Quick Verification ("Addon Base URL" Badge)

On the installation/config landing page a **badge** now appears just above the VixSrc toggle showing:

`Addon Base URL: <value>` (protocol stripped, e.g. `streamvix.mydomain.xyz`)

This is the value the addon actually resolved at startup. Use it to confirm your environment variable is working.

| Badge shows | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Your domain/IP | OK configuration | None |
| `streamvix.hayd.uk` but you expect yours | Fallback in use: env not read | Check env + restart |

Fallback checklist:
1. Variable spelled exactly `ADDON_BASE_URL` (uppercase) and NO trailing slash.  
2. Container/process restarted after adding/modifying it.  
3. You are opening the landing with the same public host you configured (not a different local IP).  
4. No hidden characters / whitespace (retype if unsure).  
5. You did NOT set the VixSrc site domain itself (ignored).  
6. Reverse proxy forwards Host / X-Forwarded-* correctly (test direct port access if unsure).  

If it still shows the fallback:
* Print env: `docker compose exec <container> env | grep ADDON_BASE_URL`.
* Ensure you haven‚Äôt declared it twice (compose + override).
* Confirm you didn‚Äôt accidentally wrap it in quotes with spaces.

Once the badge shows your domain the synthetic FHD pairing logic will reliably build `/vixsynthetic` URLs using your correct base.
  
### ‚ö° Dynamic Events: FAST vs Extractor

Dynamic sports events are loaded from the file `config/dynamic_channels.json` generated periodically by `Live.py`.

Available modes:

1. FAST (direct):
    - Activate with variable `FAST_DYNAMIC=1` or runtime `/admin/mode?fast=1`.
    - Completely skips the extractor and immediately uses the URLs present in the JSON.
    - No concurrency limit, all sources are exposed as direct streams.
    - Every FAST stream is labeled with prefix `[Player Esterno]` (üáÆüáπ emoji remains if title normalization requires it).
2. Extractor (default if `FAST_DYNAMIC=0`):
    - Each dynamic URL passes through resolution (if proxy MFP configured) before being shown.
    - Applies a concurrency CAP equal to `DYNAMIC_EXTRACTOR_CONC` (default 10) to limit simultaneous extractor requests.
    - Sources beyond the CAP are still exposed as leftover direct streams with `[Player Esterno]` (not extracted) so they‚Äôre not lost.
    - Priority: first titles matching `(it|ita|italy)`, then `(italian|scai|tnt|amazon|dason|eurosport|prime|bein|canal|sportitalia|now|rai)`, then others.

Tip: set `DYNAMIC_EXTRACTOR_CONC=1` for testing: you will see exactly 2 streams (1 extracted + 1 leftover `[Player Esterno]`).

### üß™ Quick local test example (curl)

1. Start server with: `FAST_DYNAMIC=0 DYNAMIC_EXTRACTOR_CONC=1 pnpm start`
2. Request event stream: `curl http://127.0.0.1:7860/stream/tv/<event_id>.json`
3. Enable FAST: `curl http://127.0.0.1:7860/admin/mode?fast=1`
4. Request same endpoint again: you‚Äôll notice more streams (all direct) and no leftovers.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduler Live.py

`Live.py` runs automatically EVERY 2 HOURS starting from **08:10 Europe/Rome** at: 08:10, 10:10, 12:10, 14:10, 16:10, 18:10, 20:10, 22:10, 00:10, 02:10, 04:10, 06:10.

At each execution:
* Downloads / regenerates `dynamic_channels.json`.
* The in-memory dynamic cache is invalidated and reloaded.

### üìÑ "JSON as-is" Behavior (no filters)

- The addon always reads `config/dynamic_channels.json` as-is on every request.
- No runtime date filter is applied by default.
- This ensures what you see in the catalog always matches the JSON content updated by the scheduler/`/live/update`.

If you later want to re-enable date filtering logic:

- `DYNAMIC_DISABLE_RUNTIME_FILTER=0` enables the runtime filter.
- `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR` (default `8`): hour (Europe/Rome) after which previous-day events are NOT shown at catalog anymore.
- `DYNAMIC_KEEP_YESTERDAY` (default `0`): if `1`, keeps yesterday‚Äôs events visible until physical purge.

Expectations when you re-enable filtering:

- Before `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR`: you‚Äôll see today‚Äôs events and, if present, still yesterday‚Äôs (if `DYNAMIC_KEEP_YESTERDAY=1`).
- After `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR`: you‚Äôll only see events whose `eventStart` is today (yesterday‚Äôs disappear from catalog).
- Physical purge at 02:05 rewrites the file removing yesterday‚Äôs events regardless of runtime filter.

### üßπ Event Cleanup & Grace Window

Removal of previous day events happens in two ways:

1. Runtime filter: if `process.env.DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR` (default **08**) has passed, events with previous-day `eventStart` are no longer shown in the catalog.
2. Scheduled physical purge: at **02:05** a purge rewrites the file deleting obsolete events (manual endpoint: `/live/purge`). Safety reload at **02:30**.

Note: with the default "JSON as-is" behavior active, event visibility depends only on JSON content and the physical purge; the runtime filter is disabled.

If you want to extend visibility until a certain hour just set `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR` (e.g. `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR=9`).

### üè∑Ô∏è Dynamic Stream Labels

* `[Player Esterno]` =
    - In FAST mode: prefix always present on all streams (all direct).
    - In extractor mode: prefix only on leftovers (streams beyond CAP not extracted). The first block (within CAP) has no prefix unless it already came that way from source.
* Emoji üáÆüáπ = recognized Italian title or source automatically.

### üîÅ Useful Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/live/update` | Immediately runs `Live.py` and reloads dynamics (includes SPON) |
| `/live/reload` | Invalidates cache and reloads without running script |
| `/live/purge` | Physical purge of old event file |
| `/static/reload` | Reloads static TV channels |
| `/streamed/reload` | Starts Streamed enrichment in window |
| `/streamed/reload?force=1` | Force Streamed (ignore windows) |
| `/rbtv/reload` | Starts RBTV enrichment in window |
| `/rbtv/reload?force=1` | Force RBTV (ignore windows) |
| `/spso/reload` | Starts SPSO enrichment (SportSOnline) |
| `/spso/reload?force=1` | Force SPSO (placeholder future windows) |

### üåç Relevant Environment Variables (Extended)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FAST_DYNAMIC` | 0 | 1 = use direct dynamic URLs |
| `DYNAMIC_EXTRACTOR_CONC` | 10 | Extractor request limit (CAP). With CAP=1 you get 1 extracted + 1 leftover |
| `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR` | 8 | Hour (Rome) after which previous-day events disappear from catalog |
| `DYNAMIC_DISABLE_RUNTIME_FILTER` | 1 | 1 = don‚Äôt filter by date (use JSON as-is); 0 = enable day filter |
| `DYNAMIC_KEEP_YESTERDAY` | 0 | 1 = with filter active keeps yesterday‚Äôs events too |

You can install StreamViX only locally, on a home server or on a non-flagged VPN or with smartdns to view animeunity. 
For the rest, animesaturn and vixsrc also work on Huggingface, but they have started banning StreamViX, so at your own risk.
For local installations you always need an https domain to install the addon. Or use a fork of mediaflow proxy EXE on Windows.
(works only if the PC stays on https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/mediaflow-proxy_exe/ )

### üê≥ Docker Compose (Advanced / Self-Hosting)

Ideal if you have a server or VPS and want to manage the addon via Docker.

#### Create the `docker-compose.yml` file

Save the following content in a file named `docker-compose.yml`, or add this compose to your existing file:

```yaml
services:
  streamvix:
    image: qwertyuiop8899/streamvix:latest
    container_name: streamvix
    ports:
      - "7860:7860"
    environment:
      # Base Configuration (REQUIRED)
      - BOTHLINK=true
      - MFP_URL=https://mfp.yourdomain.com   # MediaFlow Proxy URL
      - MFP_PASSWORD=yourpassword            # MediaFlow Proxy password
      - TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_key          # https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
      
      # Anime (optional)
      - ANIMEUNITY_ENABLED=true
      - ANIMESATURN_ENABLED=true
      
      # Live TV & Sports Events
      - Enable_Live_TV=true
      
      # Advanced Sports Events (optional - auto config if omitted)
      # - SPON_PROG_URL=https://sportzonline.st/prog.txt
      # - RBTV_DISCOVERY_BEFORE_MIN=15
      # - STREAMED_ENABLE=1
      
      # Local/VPS Installation (optional - for VixSrc FHD synthetic)
      # - ADDON_BASE_URL=https://streamvix.yourdomain.com
    restart: always
    
  # Watchtower for automatic image updates (optional)
  # watchtower:
  #   image: containrrr/watchtower
  #   container_name: watchtower
  #   volumes:
  #     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  #   restart: always
```

TMDB Api KEY, MFP link and MFP password and the two required flags will be managed from the installation page.

#### Run Docker Compose

Open a terminal in the directory where you saved `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command to build the image and start the container in background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
With watchtower the image will be updated automatically.

### üíª Method 3: Local Installation (for Experts NOT TESTED)

Use this method if you want to modify the source code, test new features or contribute to StreamViX development.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/StreamViX.git # Make sure it is the correct StreamViX repository
    cd StreamViX # Enter the newly cloned project directory
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```
    pnpm run build
    ```
4.  **Start the addon:**
    ```
    pnpm start
    ```
The addon will be available locally at `http://localhost:7860`.

## üîç Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Causes | Solution |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| No SPON streams in events | MFP not configured | Check `MFP_URL` and `MFP_PASSWORD` in env vars |
| SPON streams don't work | MFP unreachable or wrong password | Test MFP directly, check logs `[SPON][FALLBACK]` |
| Few SPON channels | prog.txt file empty or not downloaded | Check logs `[SPON][SCHEDULE]`, verify `sportzonline.st` reachable |
| Events disappear too early | `DYNAMIC_PURGE_HOUR` too low | Increase to 8+ or set `DYNAMIC_DISABLE_RUNTIME_FILTER=1` |
| prog.txt download fails | Domain sportzonline.st temporarily down | Set custom `SPON_PROG_URL` or `SPON_PROG_FALLBACKS` |
| TypeScript extractor not called | MFP wrap always works | Normal behavior (fallback only if MFP wrap fails) |
